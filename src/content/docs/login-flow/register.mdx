User accounts are linked to discord. It follows that you must log in with discord.

The registration is the same as a normal login, except that if you log in with a discord that does not already have an account, one will be created.

## Create An Account

4. The `Continue With Discord` button will redirect you to the discord page where you must allow the app to use your account! (This will pop up every time you log in later, but just manually accept it now, it will automatically redirect you in the future.)
