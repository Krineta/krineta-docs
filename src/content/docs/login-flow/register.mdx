User accounts are linked to discord. 

We don't have a registration procedure thanks to Discord, you can simply login without registration.

4. The `Continue With Discord` button will redirect you to the discord page where you must allow the app to use your account! (This will pop up every time you log in later, but you only need to accept it manually on the first time.)
