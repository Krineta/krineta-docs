The last step on the page is to create the WireGuard configuration.

## Creation Procedure

<Steps>

1. On the `Configurations` page, you will first see that you have no configuration.

	In the top right corner you can create a new one and see what kind and how many configurations you can create.

2. In the pop-up window, choose a name for the configuration!

	Choose the type! (You will only see the one that is available in your package.)
	
	Choose which server you want to use!

	:::note
	We currently have no free servers (The package will be discontinued.)

3. Click on the `Create` button and the configuration is immediately created and can be viewed and downloaded.

	Each configuration is given a unique identifier, which is assigned to its name by the system.

All you have to do is download the configuration, install WireGuad and configure it.
