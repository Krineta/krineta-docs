## Subscriptions

On the 'Subscriptions' page, in the 'Your Subscriptions' section, you can view the status of your active subscription, including its price and when the active period ends (i.e. when it will be renewed).

## Payment Reminders

If you have [turn on email notifications](../../login-flow/register#settings), you will always receive an email about upcoming payments, so you can top up your account with money in time if needed.
