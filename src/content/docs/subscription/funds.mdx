import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The service currently consists of two packages, which are subject to a monthly fee.

Thanks to our flat-rate top-up system, we do not need to charge your card every month to pay the monthly fee. A top-up is a one-off purchase of any amount.

## Balance Top-up Procedure

<Steps>

1. You can add funds in two ways: by clicking on the `Add Funds` button on the main page, or by clicking on the `Add Funds` button in the top right corner of the `Subscriptions` page.
